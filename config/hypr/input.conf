# Trackpad: disable-while-typing (DWT) script setup
# This enables automatic trackpad disabling while typing to prevent accidental
# cursor movement which is a particuarly annoying issue on MacBooks with large
# trackpads running Linux.
#
# To use this feature:
# 1. Open Omarchy Menu (Super+Alt+Space) → Setup → Input → Disable Trackpad While Typing
#    (or run directly: omarchy-dwt-macbook-setup-tui)
# 2. Follow the interactive setup to configure your devices
# 3. Restart Hyprland (Super+Esc, then Relaunch)
#
# The script ONLY runs if both keyboard and trackpad devices are configured
# env = OMARCHY_TRACKPAD_DWT_KEYBOARD,/dev/input/event3  # REQUIRED - your keyboard device
# env = OMARCHY_TRACKPAD_DWT_TRACKPAD,/dev/input/event2  # REQUIRED - your trackpad device
# env = OMARCHY_TRACKPAD_DWT_TIMEOUT,1.5                 # Optional - timeout in seconds (default: 1.5)
